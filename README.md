A simple external cheat for roblox that modifies walk speed and jump power of local player's character. It was simple so any one who wants to understand externals can read this code and understand something hopefully. By the way it uses read process memory and write process memory for reading and writing process memory <ins>**so you will get BANNED if you use this.**</ins>
